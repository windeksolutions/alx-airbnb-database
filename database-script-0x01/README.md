#SQL Table Creation Task
Overview
This project involves creating SQL CREATE TABLE statements based on a provided database specification. The goal is to define the database schema accurately and efficiently for optimal performance and data integrity.

##Objectives
Define each entity in the database using CREATE TABLE statements.

Specify appropriate data types for each column.

Set primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.

Add necessary constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK) where applicable.

Create indexes on relevant columns to improve query performance.

##Deliverables
SQL script file (schema.sql) containing all CREATE TABLE statements.

Proper documentation of relationships and constraints within the script.

##Notes
Ensure foreign key references match primary keys in related tables.

Use meaningful index names and avoid unnecessary indexing.

Test the script in a SQL environment to validate syntax and constraints.
